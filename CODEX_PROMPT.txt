Scaffold an MVP web app named 'ppt-knowledge-doc'.

Goal: User drags & drops a .pptx. Backend extracts slide text and images, runs OCR on images, and generates a structured 'knowledge document' JSON plus a downloadable Markdown file.

Tech choices:
- Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript) with a drag-and-drop upload component, progress UI, and results display. Provide a Download Markdown button.
- Backend: Python FastAPI.
- PPT parsing: python-pptx. Extract per-slide text, speaker notes, and images (save to a temp job folder).
- OCR: use pytesseract for now (document that macOS will need tesseract installed; include a fallback that skips OCR if not available).

API:
- POST /api/upload (multipart) -> returns jobId
- GET /api/job/{jobId} -> returns status + partial results
- GET /api/job/{jobId}/download -> returns the generated Markdown file

Implementation details:
- Use a simple in-memory job store for dev; structure code so it can be swapped for Redis later.
- Create clear data models: SlideInfo, ExtractedImageInfo, KnowledgeDoc.
- Write a README with setup steps (python venv, pip install, next install), and include a 'make dev' or scripts.

Project structure:
- /frontend (Next.js)
- /backend (FastAPI)
- root README.md

Also add basic logging and error handling. Keep it runnable locally.

When completely finished, run: clawdbot gateway wake --text "Done: scaffolded ppt-knowledge-doc MVP (Next.js + FastAPI) with PPTX upload, extraction, OCR, and Markdown download" --mode now
